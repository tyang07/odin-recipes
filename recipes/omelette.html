            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ cup stock</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>½ tsp potato starch, dissolved in 1 tbsp water</li>
            <li>Spices (Paprika and Parsley) - optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up oil or butter in an ovenproof pan, and put in the onions. Saute till it starts to brown. Meanwhile, preheat up
            the oven to 250 Celcius.</li>
            <li>Put in the potatoes, carrots and pumpkin, and stirfry until they are all coated with oil.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes, carrots, and pumpkin are half-cooked, put in the stock and pile the cabbage leaves on top. Cover with
            a lid and cook for about 3 mins, or until the stock starts to bubble.</li>
            <li>Uncover and mix. Pop into the oven and roast at 200 C for 20 mins, or until stock mostly dries up.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, lets make our sauce. Heat up a little drizzle of oil, and stir fry the garlic until they start to brown.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste, stock and spices (optional) , and stir until it is mixed well.</li>
            <li>When the sauce starts to simmer, add in the honey and mix well.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and mix in the potato starch mixture. Put it in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Now for the eggs! (Winning recipes have to be a bit more complicated, right?) In a non-stick pan, heat up the oil/butter
            for the eggs.</li>
            <li>When the oil/butter is hot enough to solidify a drop of egg when you test it, immediately throw in the eggs and turn off
            the heat. Move spatula in a scrambling motion, but make sure that the overall shape is still circular.</li>
            <li>Take roasted vegetables and place some on one side of the pan.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese, and fold the omelette over. (Don’t forget to leave some cheese for the other omelettes you are going to
            make.</li>
            <li>Slide it onto a plate and pour the tomato sauce over.</li>
            <li>Repeat for all the other omelettes you are making.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
