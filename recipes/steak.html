        </ul>

        <p>Cooking the meat</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp red wine</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the sauce</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp red wine</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>To make the meat</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince the onion finely: Lay the half onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the
            root end, make ¼-inch (6 mm) vertical slices to within ½ inch (1.3 cm) of the root end. Next, with the knife's edge
            toward the root, make ¼-inch (6 mm) horizontal slices, again keeping the root end intact.</li>
            <li>Then, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made. To chop the onions finer, you can run your
            knife through them using a rocking motion. Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions will go
            flying around the room.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat and add the onions.</li>
            <li>Sauté the onions until tender and almost translucent. Transfer to a large bowl and let it cool.</li>
            <li>Once the onions are cool, add the ground beef and pork to the bowl. Add the salt, black pepper as you like, and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Add the milk, panko, and egg.</li>
            <li>Start mixing it all together with a silicone spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Then, switch to mixing by hand and knead the mixture until it's sticky and pale.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into quarters (4 oz or 113 g each) or six smaller portions. Scoop out one portion.</li>
            <li>Toss it from one hand to the other repeatedly about five times in order to release any air inside the mixture (see the
            video link above). Tip: Without releasing the air inside, the hamburger steaks will likely crack while cooking.</li>
            <li>Make an oval-shaped patty and place on a tray or plate. Repeat with the remaining portions. Cover the patties with
            plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the meat combines well and
            the fat solidifies.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>To cook the meat</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat and place the patties gently into the pan. Indent the center of each patty
            with two fingers because the centers will rise with the heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties until browned on the bottom side, about 3 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for another 3 minutes
            until browned.</li>
            <li>Add the red wine for steaming the patties and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 5-7 minutes
            to thoroughly cook the inside of the patties (adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of the patties).</li>
            <li>Uncover and check that it's done by inserting a skewer; if clear juice comes out, it's done. Increase the heat to medium
            to let the alcohol finish evaporating. When it’s almost finished, transfer the hamburger steaks to individual plates. Do
            not wash the pan as you will make the sauce next using the pan juices.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>To make the sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same frying pan (without cleaning), add the unsalted butter, ketchup, and tonkatsu sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the water and red wine for the sauce to the pan.</li>
            <li>Mix well together and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat; let the alcohol evaporate.</li>
            <li>When the sauce thickens (and you can draw a line on the bottom of the frying pan with a spatula), remove from the heat.
            Drizzle the sauce over the hamburger steaks. Pour the leftover sauce in a small bowl or jar and bring it to the table in
            case anyone wants to add more. We typically serve steamed rice, miso soup, and steamed vegetables or a salad with this
            meal.</li>
